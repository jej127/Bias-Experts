## Improving Bias Mitigation through Bias Experts in Natural Language Understanding
We propose a new debiasing framework that introduces binary classifiers between the auxiliary model and the main model, coined bias experts. Specifically, each bias expert is trained on a binary classification task derived from the multi-class classification task via the One-vs-Rest approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy effectively reduces the gap and consistently improves the state-of-the-art on various challenge datasets such as HANS.
